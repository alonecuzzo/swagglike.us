What is swagglike.us?

It's a freshness index.  It's the google of swagg on the internet.  People go and like stuff, that stuff has tags, and after enough voting the stuff will bubble up to the top in the various categories.  

You get a swagg rating for the votes that you receive and other variables. *Maybe participation etc... 


Different Releases:

Alpha: Video & Splash page.  Discusses the features to coming in the first version, also inviting people to sign up for the beta list. We meet Jay-Breeze and he discusses the nature of swag & fresh on the internet.

Beta: Images are scraped. People can like stuff, that's it.  The categories should be built out and the charts will be present.  This will be mostly testing phase inviting users to comment on interface etc.

Version 1.0: Shortly after this feedback period, changes will be made and then users/accounts will be created & people will be able to add images themselves.
**Note at this point, people will have to build their own personal tag list of stuff that they're interested in to filter their feed.  We can't have every tag listed once people start adding their own.

Version 1.1: People get profile pages.

Down the road:
1. Contests- outfit of the day, challenges similar to day9 tv to keep things fresh...
2. Swagg battles/tournaments, like starcraft
3. point incentives - maybe like an ipad giveaway
4. "user of the month" ~ like employee of the month, also think year-book... class geek, jock etc...
5. browser plugins, ipad/iphone apps so people can post to the feed easier


*Who is Jay-Breeze?
I'm like Steve Jobs and Kanye West in a fist fight.  


*Why swagglike.us?  What's the need?  Who cares?
You know, geeks is the new G's in 2011.  Facebook was just valued at $50 billion.  What jock you know is clocking that?  I mean I'm with facebook and all.  I can't lie, I check that shit a lot.  The shit is addictive, but it's not fresh.  Facebook is like McDonalds, swagglike.us is like a VIP reservation only restaurant.  This is a place where you will come to check for shit with style, not to flip through 50 photos of some of your drunken girlfriends at some club making ducky faces.  This shit right here is fly.


*What about Tumblr?  The interface feels awfully similar...
Tumblr is dope.  It's a great way to favorite stuff that you like, but only on Tumblr.  We're letting you like and post from any site and on top of that index it.  Like on Tumblr I have over 7,000 liked items.  How the hell am I supposed to find the sneakers I like, or the girls that I think are hot from that list?  What if I want to share that list but I don't want people to see all the naked ladies that I have on that list?

These sites nowadays are about quantity, swagglike.us is about quality.  If we only get 100 users that are fresh, I say we beat Facebook easy.
